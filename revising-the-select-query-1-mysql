Challenge: 

Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

Solution: 

Let's first take a closer look at the CITY table itself. We can do this either by querying the whole table or by looking over the handy dandy table hackerrank provides. 
We'll find that it includes fields for ID, name, countrycode, district, and population. What we want our query to do is to output all columns for records that match two 
specifications. This includes when population is greater than 100000 and when the city's country is America. 

To start, we'll write down the select query format. 
-- 
SELECT 
FROM 
WHERE 
-- 

Then, we will add an asterik (*) under SELECT to tell sql we want all the columns and city under FROM to tell sql we want * from the city table. 

-- 
SELECT 
*
FROM 
city
WHERE 
-- 

Next, we need to add in the two criteria under the WHERE clause. 

To find all American cities, we need to look in the countrycode column. As we want American cites, we'll use the countrycode of USA. 

Note: The countrycode column is a VARCHAR datatype. Essentially, that means it is a string and we need to make sure to include apostrophes around it. 

--
SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city 
WHERE 
countrycode = 'USA'
--

Lastly, we need to add in the second criteria of population. 

To find population of over 100000 we can use the operator > between population and 100000: 

population > 100000 

Additionally, since we want the output to show cities that are in America that have a population of over 100000, we'll need to use an AND clause between the two 
criteria. This tells sql to only pull all the columns for records that are in America AND have a population > 100000.
--
SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city 
WHERE 
countrycode = 'USA' 
AND population > 100000;
--

TL;DR 

SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city 
WHERE 
countrycode = 'USA' 
AND population > 100000;
