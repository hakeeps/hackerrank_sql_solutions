Challenge: 

Query all columns (attributes) for every row in the CITY table.

Solution: 

Let's start by first writing down a basic select query format including the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. 
--
SELECT 
FROM 
WHERE 
--

We can remove the WHERE clause as the challenge is not looking for any specific information from the table. 

--
SELECT 
FROM 
--

Next, we can add in the name of table under the FROM clause. 

-- 
SELECT 
FROM 
city
--

Now, to query all attributes from the CITY table, we can put an asterisk (*). The * here stands for all columns. 

--
SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city
--

Finally, we can add a semi-colon and submit! 

--
SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city;
--

TL;DR 

Answer: 

SELECT 
* 
FROM 
city;
